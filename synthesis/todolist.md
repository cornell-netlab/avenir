# TodoList

## Immediate (Today)
+ Add assert
+ slides (3-4) plus backup slides

## Next (Monday)
+ Solve Subproblem 1a (i.e. for a set of traces, can we fill in the holes so that the real program can implement the logical one)
+ Examples (maybe implemented from InfoSys???)

## Later 
+ Implement CEGIS
