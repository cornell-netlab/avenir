Mininet dev tools README

This directory contains modules for Mininet that are
intended to help with ONOS core and application development.

They can be imported into Python scripts, or invoked using
mn's --custom option.

Test topologies for use with Mininet may be found in
../../test/topos


onos.py:

onos.py provides a Mininet controller class which makes it
convenient to create ONOS clusters in a single VM. It also
creates a customizable control network. Additional information
may be found in the module comment and on the docs wiki.

example: sudo mn --custom onos.py --controller onos,1 --topo linear,10


bmv2.py:

bmv2.py provides a Mininet switch class which enables use of
the BMv2 P4 software switch.

Additional information may be found on the docs wiki.


examples/:

The examples/ directory contains example scripts which may make
use of onos.py or other modules in this directory.
