<!-- The transform here goes from a 0,0 centred grid of -180 to 180 of
    longitude to -75 to 75 of latitude
     It is mapped to a 2000x1000 SVG grid with -500,0 at the top left
     (The SVG viewbox of ONOS is 1000x1000 - for the geo grid we wanted
     to keep it the same height 1000 representing +75 latitude down to
     -75 latitude, but double the width. Why 75? There's no city in the
     world above 70 - Murmansk)
     The 6.66 represents 1000/150 and the 5.55 represents 2000/360
     The reason for the difference is that mercator projection widens
     countries in the northern and southern extremities, and so
     the map is squashed horizontally slightly here to compensate
     (with no squashing the width would be 2400)-->
